# YI Home - iOS

As of today, there is no international version of YI Camera V2, and the Chinese version is only supported on Android (multilingual) and iOS (Chinese only) on Chinese App Store.

Unfortunately, the YI Home Chinese application only provides Chinese language, that's why, even if you switch to Chinese App Store to install it and go back to English or French App Store, the app still remains in Chinese.

The aim of this project is to provide other languages to the Chinese application on iOS.

An iOS application is protected against modifications, but with some manipulations, we can achieve our goals !

When we modify something in the application, we need to resign it. But to be able to sign the application, the binary must be unencrypted. Apple claims that an application can't be decrypted, but fortunately, this is not totally true.
